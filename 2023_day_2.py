##Whe landed in snow island
##An elf gives us a small game to spend time in mean time??
##In a bag there are blue, red and green cubes inside of it. 
##Elf randomly pulls out cubes each round of each game.
## Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
## Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
## Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
##Elf askes which games would be possible if bag had only contained 12 red, 13 green, 14 blue cubes?
##Game 1 and 2 would be possible if you look at 3 game there once showed 20 red thus making it impossible!
##Then you add ID od each game to a sum in this case is 3!

##Now tell the sum of ID's where 12 red, 13 green, 14 blue cubes is possible?
